This repository houses the **Posture Pulse project**, an open-source wearable device designed to **monitor and improve posture in real time**. Developed by our team during the Makers Asylum Innovation School program, it uses **ESP32-C3, IMU sensors, and flex sensors** to detect slouching and activate a **linear actuator** to gently alert the wearer.
